1. The lazy evaluation .noalias has been used in matrix multiplication.
2. The inputs of algorithm 2 shouldn't be GivensRotation anymore, since U and V at the final step may not be Givens Rotation matrix. Then I modified the input types of U and V to be T (no longer Tu and Tv), which may cause
bugs when implementing tests.
