1. The lazy evaluation .noalias has been used in matrix multiplication.
2. The inputs of algorithm 2 shouldn't be GivensRotation anymore, since U and V at the final step may not be Givens Rotation matrix. Then I modified the input types of U and V to be T (no longer Tu and Tv), which may cause
bugs when implementing tests.

1. Fix the bug of extra cout.
2. Inputs of functions could be Eigen::Matrix or Eigen::MatrixBase. This is really different when implementing algorithm.
3. Keyword "enable_if_t" to take in different sizes.
